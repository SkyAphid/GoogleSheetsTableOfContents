# Google Sheets - Table Of Contents Generator
This handy script will let you generate Table of Contents sheets for your Google Sheets document.

## About ##
Google Sheets doesn't have a built in Table of Contents generator like Google Docs has, so I built one myself and also added a basic Outline system to it. I originally checked the web store and only found one add on that handled this functionality, but it was unreliable and therefore useless to me. I put this together in a few hours to replace it so that no one else would have to bang their heads against the awful Google API like I did to make one themselves.

## Installation ##
- Open Tools dropdown from the Google Sheet Toolbar
- Select Script Editor
- Copy Code.gs and Sidebar.html into the Script Editor from this repo
- Close the Script Editor
- Open Tools dropdown from the Google Sheet Toolbar
- Hover over "Macros"
- Select "Import"
- Find "NOKORIWARETableOfContentsGenerator"
- Click "ADD FUNCTION" to its lower right

## Using It ##
After installing:
- Open Tools dropdown from the Google Sheet toobar
- Hover Macros
- Click NOKORIWARETableOfContentsGenerator

This will start the program.

## Soapbox ##
By the time I finished this, I was so tired of Google's awful APIs that I wanted to get as far away from it as possible. I had intended to make it an add on and put it on the Google Chrome Web Store for ease of use/convienence and also post it on here so people could access the code, but it's probably easier for everyone involved if I just post it here. I'm tired of spending hours trying to figure out how to use basic parts of their APIs because they think it's a good idea to try and support as many languages as possible (but fail to support a single one of them well).
