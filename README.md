## About ##
Google Sheets doesn't have a built in Table of Contents generator like Google Docs has, so I built one myself and also added a basic Outline system to it. I originally checked the web store and only found one addon that handled this functionality, but it was unreliable and easy to break. So I decided to take one for the team and put this together in a few hours. My hope is that my sacrifice means that no one else will ever have to bang their heads against the awful Google API like I did to get basic functionality out of their spreadsheets.

## Features ##
- Table of Contents Generator: a sheet with links to various defined sections can be automatically created
- Outline functionality that allows you to jump to sections quickly from the sidebar
- Sort button that will automatically re-organize your sheets alphabetically by section
- Built-in instruction manual that will tell you how to use the tool

Data used by table of contents generator are located in the A column, so that column must be reserved for section names. Cell A1 is the name of the Table of Contents. Everything below that cell denotes section names (e.g. equivalent to chapters in books). Empty cells are ignored. Non-empty cells are added to the Table of Contents and automatically linked to by the generator.
